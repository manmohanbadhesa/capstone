# Project Title

## Overview

What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

There is a group of about a thousand people that gather every sunday to pray together for roughly 4 hours. They have a break in between for 15 minutes in which they eat snacks with tea. My friends and relatives put down money to take about 100 samosas during the break. I do not like asking every week for people to transfer me 10$ each but would other people in the community to help meet the target of 100 samosas. So the website will be desgined to monitor a status of the current total of samosas and allow people to pay directly from the website.   

### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

Allowing people from the community to contribute to the service in a more efficient manner and complications.

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.

Mainly community people that want to contribute to the event every Sunday. They will be able to see the count and able to click on either a $5 or $10 button to make a contribution. Payment options are a special consideraiton

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

People should be able to make a contribution to the overall count of samosas bought. There will be a reels section that will display the video from the most recent event. There should be a payment form for the people to interact with. 

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

Axios, Sass
React
React-router
Knex
Figma possibly

### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.

Diving deeper could use Google Payment API, Apple Pay API or other payment APIs

Main home page:
Displays count of samosas, target samosas, and reels

### Mockups

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.
/Get
-user data
-weekly count

### Auth

Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.

get frontend and endpoints setup by this sunday, add more funcality all of next week

## Nice-to-haves

Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Under nice-to-haves, you can list any additional features you may complete if you have extra time, or after finishing.
